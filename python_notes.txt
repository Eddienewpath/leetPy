1. python dictionary key must be immutable data type such as string, integer, tuples
2. python ways to create a hashtable frequency table:
    example: 
        import collections
        a = [1,2,2,3,4,5,5]
        freq = collections.Counter(a)
        print(freq) 
        # return Counter({2: 2, 5: 2, 1: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1})

3. empty list have implicit booleaness value to false  and None is value to False 
4. deque is a data structure like stack and queue combined with fast operations than normal list 
5. Tuples are faster than lists. If you're defining a constant set of values and all you're ever going to do with it is iterate through it, use a tuple instead of a list
6. pythonic way of assignmen using python unpacking
7. enumberate() assign a index to a value : for i, v in enumerate(alist): -> (0, 'apple'), (1, 'pear')....
8. zip(l1, l2), for example a = [1,2,3], b = [4,5,6] zip(a, b) => [(1,4), (2,6), (3,5)], if a and b has difference length, use the shorter one to zip
